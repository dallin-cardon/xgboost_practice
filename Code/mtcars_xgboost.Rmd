# Overview
In this document, I will try to understand how xgboost works for classification. To better understand how to use this tool, I will use the mtcars dataset, and try to build a classifier that can tell me what type of car something is, given other data about it. I understand that mtcars is a very small dataset, but I don't intend for this to be a practical model. 

# Load Packages

Z# Research
To understand xgboosting from the ground up, I'll follow the xgboost tutorial available at https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html
