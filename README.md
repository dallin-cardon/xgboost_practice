# xgboost_practice
I need to better understand xgboost conceptually, as well as how to use it with the xgboost R package.

This repo includes a log of myself as I try to understand xgboost. Under data, we can find data about bike rentals which will be used to better understand how boosted trees work. 

The mtcars_xgboost.Rmd is a document I will be working on primarily.
